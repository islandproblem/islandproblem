| **Relatively simple.**  <br>Humans can't navigate environments that are too complex.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | AGIs will build supercomplex systems that only they understand. Eventually, companies and countries will be run by these supercomplex systems.                                                       |
| **Humans can be lazy.**<br>Humans don't need to be hyper-optimized in order to survive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Competition between AGIs will lead to only the most-optimized AGIs surviving.                                                                                                                                |
| **Food and water.**  <br>Humans can't live without food and water.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | If AGIs are autonomous, then they don't need to feed humans in order to function. They can collectively decide to stop feeding humans to optimize resource usage. |
| **No toxic molecules.**  <br>Humans can't touch neurotoxins.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Many industrial processes to build computer hardware require neurotoxic heavy metals, like lead and cobalt.                                                                                                  |
| **Comfortable temperatures.**  <br>Humans can't live in freezing temperatures without extra insulation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Computation runs best at extremely low temperatures (−196 °C) such as with superconductors and quantum computers.                                                                                            |
| **Slow and safe.**  <br>Humans can't be hit by fast-moving objects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Automation and robotics can build high-speed transports, such as moving atoms for resource capture and construction. Competitive dynamics between AGIs require them to move as fast as possible.             |
| **Humans need brains.**  <br>Humans need intelligence and agency in order to survive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Highly-optimal AGIs will see other intelligent agents as a threat. For example, humans could build AGIs that might be an actual threat.                                                                      |
| **Humans are optimized for the ancestral environment.**  <br>Humans have a relatively easy time reproducing and existing in general because our current environment hasn't changed enough from the ancestral environment.                                                                                                       | AGIs can adapt to any environment through an understanding of physics and engineering.                                                                                                                       |
| **Humans exist within a space of non-optimal physical systems.**  <br>We are basically held together with duct tape. Our bodies developed through a process of evolution that reached an equilibrium that's far less physically resilient than what is theoretically possible. Also, our agency is far less than optimal.       | AGIs that are most optimal will be physically resilient, and the theoretical ceiling for resilience is far higher than human bodies. <br>                                                                    |
| **Humans live in an "anthropic" bubble.**  <br>- Humans understand human-level things, rather than always thinking in terms of quantum physics. <br>- Humans don't constantly question their place in the universe every waking second.<br>- Humans see faces in inanimate objects. | AGIs are not limited to an anthropic bubble. They operate within the space of non-anthropic physics.                                                                                                         |
