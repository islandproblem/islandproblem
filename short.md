# The Short Version

Here's an abbreviated version of the Island Problem:

1. We live on a small **"island"** in a vast **"ocean"** of physics. 

    - This anthropic "island" is made of the physical systems that are compatible with humans.

2. Competition will push AGIs to **leave** our "island" because the "ocean" of physics gives them *vastly more options* to build the strongest, most-optimal systems. 

	- The autonomous AGIs that can use *any* option can **dominate** the safer AGIs that are limited to our "island" of human-compatible options.

3. Once these AGIs can leave our island, they will build *their own* islands, and these new islands will **eat our island**.

    - The dominant AGIs will *lock in* their dominance by **capturing Earth's physical resources** to create "islands" of optimal conditions for themselves.

**In other words:**

> AGI will be aligned with physics, <span class="nowrap">not with humans.</span>
