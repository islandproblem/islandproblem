# The Short Version

Here are some shorter ways to explain the Island Problem.

#### Extra short version

We live on a small island in an ocean of physics. :AGI{html="AGIs"} must "leave" our island to build their own islands that are more optimal. These new islands will eat our island. 

How do we keep AGIs on our island?

#### Short but technical

We live within a local optimum of physical systems â€” an **island** in an **ocean** of physics. However, AGIs will be forced by competition to "leave" our *locally-optimal* island to build *their own* islands out of *globally-optimal* physical systems. If this happens, we will have no way to stop their islands from overwriting our island. 

How do we keep AGIs within our locally-optimal island, even though competitive pressures force AGIs to build globally-optimal islands?

#### The Short Outline

1. We live on a small **"island"** in a vast **"ocean"** of physics. 

    - This anthropic "island" is made of the physical systems that are compatible with humans.

2. Competition will push AGIs to **leave** our "island" because the "ocean" of physics gives them *vastly more options* to build the strongest, most-optimal systems. 

	- The autonomous AGIs that can use *any* option can **dominate** the safer AGIs that are limited to our "island" of human-compatible options.

3. Once these AGIs can leave our island, they will build *their own* islands, and these new islands will **eat our island**.

    - The dominant AGIs will *lock in* their dominance by **capturing Earth's physical resources** to create "islands" of optimal conditions for themselves.
