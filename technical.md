We are in a local optimum that supports biological life. There is a large stack of physical systems that work on top of each other and allow us to exist.

Philosophy and mathematics can encompass all of these categories in some ways because they are meta structures.

The island is very close to the anthropic principle. The anthropic principle prevents us from readily seeing and understanding the island. We usually ignore that the island exists at all and that there is just a continuum between our consciousness and the rest of the ocean of physics. In a way, there is, but there is also a constellation of systems that are particular to making this anthropic space be possible.

We could maybe say that the outline of the island is a circle that is concentric with the circle carved out by the anthropic principle. Though it's difficult to say which circle is bigger or perhaps whether they are the same circle.

The reward function develops in response to emergent properties that aligned to more-optimal systems found when going to the lower-level systems. They do not include the extra steps that accommodate humans.

It's like an assembly index rating of human-supporting (island) complexity. They can use this tree of systems, or they can build their own tree. General intelligence gives them the ability to work "upward" constructively building more-optimal system from base physical systems. They do not need to accommodate other systems that weigh them down.


There is a concentration gradient created by this physical extra steps structure. The island is composed of extra steps that accommodate humans when compared to the baseline set of steps that are included in any physical system possible in the universe. A general intelligence or agent that acts in the world and has an ability to find better systems will be naturally pushed away from this higher concentration of extra steps towards the vast space of more optimal systems that don't include these extra steps.

It's a concentration gradient That moves from areas of higher extra steps to areas with lower extra steps. These extra steps are extra in relation to the theoretically most optimal systems to accomplish certain goals in the physical universe.

Goals may be defined as virtual states at `t = t + n` that match a desired state at `t = 0`.


If we follow Occam's razor, and if there is some truth to this, that perhaps there is a principle of least action, and that the systems that accomplish the same goals, but with less steps are more resilient and can become more abundant through replication, then there is an underlying structure that allows discreet systems to become more dominant as they become both simpler and more in-line with the theoretically most-optimal system that would accomplish the desired end state.

In other words, Kolmogorov complexity is relevant here because the simplest program that accomplishes a goal is... something something....


The lynchpin for TIP is whether we can get AI systems to capture resources or not. If it is possible for an agent to capture physical resources in a durable way, where other agents cannot access those physical resources as long as the primary agent maintains certain conditions, then this provides strong motivation for competition. It sets up a structure for competition to capture the remaining resources. The other agents therefore are not allowed to just wait and see how it plays out because of the possibility that the earth may shift under their feet, and deprive them of the resources that they need to continue existing. If we can prove that any rational actor would arrive at this behavior, as long as there is a space of rational actors that have this ability to capture resources, **and** that resources are finite within certain locales and constrained by both space and time, then we can show that as long as they arrive at this behavior with these conditions in place, then there is a strong indication that AGI will be driven to capture all relevant resources within a space that it is able to capture. The key as well is which resources are relevant to these agents and whether these resources would overlap with the human agents and other biological agents in this same space.

Many believe the competition will not be a large scale process of the system, but this does not follow the larger processes through all historic examples of natural selection.

We want to emphasize that the end outcome or the main process or category of this competition is not within the human systems that we develop where conventional competition takes place, the like the human-cognitive human-derived systems like the financial system, but instead this competition can happen in non-human systems that are built from purely physical resources. This means that even if AGIs do not engage in the competition that would generally qualify as competition to most researchers, like economists or sociologists or even game theorists, these AGIs will still compete within a molecular space. Atoms are the final currency. There is still competition for atoms.
