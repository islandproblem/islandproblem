rating: 5
summary: Augment humans so that they are smarter, faster, and more resilient, making the "island" of our biology bigger.

Rather than constraining AGI to stay within human limitations, this approach suggests expanding human capabilities to match or complement AGI abilities. Through cognitive enhancement, brain-computer interfaces, genetic modification, or other augmentation technologies, we could make humans more capable of participating in an AGI-dominated world.

The goal is to "expand the island" of human-compatible systems by making humans themselves more capable of operating in the broader space of possible systems.

Potential benefits:
- Humans could potentially keep pace with AGI development and maintain oversight
- Enhanced humans might be able to understand and interact with supercomplex AGI systems
- The "island" of human-compatible systems becomes larger and more robust

However, this approach faces significant challenges:

- **Speed of Development**: Human enhancement may not keep pace with AGI development, creating a dangerous gap period.

- **Fundamental Limits**: Even enhanced humans may hit biological or physical limits that AGIs can surpass.

- **Enhancement Risks**: Human augmentation technologies could be dangerous, potentially causing new problems before solving the AGI problem.

- **Social Disruption**: Widespread human enhancement could create new forms of inequality and social conflict.

- **Competitive Pressure**: Enhanced humans still face the same competitive pressures as AGIs â€” to use the most optimal systems available, which may still lead away from human-compatible options.

While expanding human capabilities is promising, it may only delay rather than solve the fundamental divergence problem.
