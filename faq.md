# FAQ


## What are the different purposes of the Island Problem?

The purposes of the Island Problem are:

- Provide a mental model for thinking about the complete landscape of AGIs interacting on Earth.
- Recruit people to solve the Island Problem.
- Gather solutions.

## Is the "island" the Earth?

Not quite. It's a bit more abstract. The island is all of the physical systems that support human life. Some of those systems could be in outer space.


## Isn't this just instrumental convergence?

Sort of. It's more like instrumental *divergence*. You start at the island, and you *diverge* to the ocean. This is also the default process. It's like a concentration gradient. You go from a high concentration of extra steps that accommodate humans, to a low concentration of extra steps. This underlying physical structure creates a "slope" that inevitably leads AGIs to drift "downhill" on a path of least resistance â€” leading them off our "island" and towards the "ocean" of more-optimal systems.


## How does this relate to alignment?

The Island Problem is like the hard problem of alignment. Even if we create an aligned and supremely ethical AGI, it is still built on top of physics, and so the vast space of non-human physical systems will always be eating at alignment from underneath.


## What is the official acronym of the Island Problem?

**The acronym is TIP.** We're including the "T" for "The" because, while awkward to use "The" (they don't call it "The Facebook" anymore for a reason) it would otherwise just be "IP" and that acronym is already pretty well occupied by Internet Protocol and Intellectual Property.

Also, the Island Problem is all about the ***TIP***ping point where AGI goes critical.


## How do I write it in a sentence?

You just capitalize "Island" and "Problem" rather than "The". For example: This is the Island Problem.
